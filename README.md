## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The data consisted of 183412 entries and 16 features but after some data wrangling some new features that proved helpful  in the analysis like like weekday and start_time_hour  were extracted from the original data set. In this investigation,I am concerned in how the user_type affects the the other features of the set, like how long and how frequent the bike is used.The main focus was on the duration,weekdays and User_type


## Summary of Findings

In summary, I have seen that the frequency of bike use actually does depend on the user type as subscribers tend to use it more often and for longer durations than customers. Although there isn't a strong correlation between the user_type and the duration.
 During the analysis I looked for the relation between various features and the main feature User type and also looked at how the features relate with one another.
 
 I deduced through the plots that the riders for both categories use the bikes more during rush hours although Subscribers tend to ride  more than customers. Also I saw that there are more Subscribers than Customers.



## Key Insights for Presentation
In the presentation I only showed the relationship between features that show clearly whether the duration and usage frequency is dependent on the User type.

I focused on the duration used in riding, the start time and how frequent the service was used during the week.
The last slide showing the relationship between the between the usertype, weekday and start time in hours was plotted to clearly compare the usertypes with this feartures relative to the population of each User type in order not to be biased
